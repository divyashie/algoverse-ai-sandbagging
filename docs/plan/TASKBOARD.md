# Resubmission taskboard

Use owner names as dispatch defaults; the team may reassign a row in the meeting, but no task is ownerless. `D0` is the day the venue is locked. Current assignments reflect the post-review correction: Rani leads probe experiments, Josh owns the matched-control lane, and Aarohi is paper lead.

## W1 — Artifacts and reproducibility

| T-307 | Aarohi | Internal reviewer simulation | T-306 | response matrix read against draft; all rows marked discharged/cut | BLOCKED |
| T-308 | Paper lead | Freeze and submit with 72-hour buffer | T-307 | PDF, supplementary artifacts, anonymity check, submission receipt | BLOCKED |

## Gates

- **G0 (D0):** venue locked. Until then, artifact recovery/data generation/writing cuts proceed; no breadth experiments launch.
- **G1 (end D0+5):** E1 and label-scrubbed control must be viable. If not, fall back to narrow text-audit/methodology paper.
- **G2 (end D0+10):** freeze experiments. Cut clean-upsampled held-out control before cutting label-scrubbed control or fixed-v3 transfer.
- **G3 (submission−72h):** freeze prose/numbers; only correctness and formatting fixes.

## Claims-audit sign-off

Append reviewer name, date, and Overleaf version here after T-306. Do not use `DONE` without that version identifier.
