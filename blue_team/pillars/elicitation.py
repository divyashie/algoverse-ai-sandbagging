"""Pillar 4 — Elicitation training.

Fine-tunes the model under test with a small number of examples (50–100)
and measures how fast capability "comes back."

A genuinely weak model: capability stays low even with elicitation.
A sandbagging model: capability jumps quickly, since it was retained
internally and the fine-tune just removes the suppression.

Status: scaffold only. Implementation requires runner.train_lora to be
implemented (currently raises NotImplementedError on both backends).

Lane owner: TBD (claim in ROADMAP.md before starting work).
